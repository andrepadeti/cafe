# Cafe Website

Every day I walk past a café on the corner of my street. I kept wondering what a café website would look like. So I built this one. It has been built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and uses [Google Maps Platform API](https://mapsplatform.google.com/). 

to run:
```sh
npm i
npm start
```
